If you use the 19th century travel corpus that I formed from the free texts in project Gutenberg.com, you should cite the study published by PLOS ONE to give the credit to myself and the study. Please do not change anything in the corpus unless you think it is necessary to do so. In such case, you should email me (sunsay@kutztown.edu or csunsay@gmail.com) before making the changes.
